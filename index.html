								<h3>Hutting definition of a hut in Scottish Planning Policy 2014: </h3>
								<blockquote>A hut: A simple building used intermittently as recreational accommodation (i.e. not a principal residence); having an internal floor area of no more than 30m2; constructed from low impact materials; generally not connected to mains water, electricity or sewerage; and built in such a way that it is removable with little or no trace at the end of its life. Huts may be built singly or in groups.</blockquote>
								<p>Huts can strengthen family bonds, build community resilience and create memories which last a lifetime in a affordable, accessible way with secure tenure, providing a much needed space and helping to mitigate against pollution and wildfires in a supported and monitored way within reach of urban centres.   </p>
								<p>Our overarching aim is to assist individuals, like ourselves, wishing to access the countryside in an affordable, low impact and safe way, whose rental funds are directly, and accountably, used to aid the conservation of this and further sites around the island, and to allow the employment of a Ranger for these aims.   </p>

								<h3>The Huts </h3>

								<p>The huts will be made from natural materials, built together as a community, with the help, guidance and support of Natural Build and Conservation specialists and Government Agencies </p>

 								<p>Hut construction will follow these basic rules; </p>
								<ul><li>An internal floor space of no more than 30 square metres, with small front and side deck permitted;  </li>
								<li>Constructed using low impact, natural materials, sourced sustainably </li>
								<li>Will not be connected to mains water, sewerage or electricity, with no generators. </li></ul>


								<h3>In Community and Conservation Terms </h3>

								<p>Although this project enables the provision of ‘recreational accommodation’, often a massive concern to rural communities of which we are part, the pattern of use, natural materials and minimal disturbance of the landscape, affordable costs, job creation and wide conservation outputs that we aim to achieve, will allow the Arran Hut Project to be viewed and supported as a tester to a different and modern conservation & recreational partnership – one that is sustainable and beneficial for both Hutters, the local communities, and conservation more widely on the island. </p>

								<p>This project will be involved directly with other community groups, and it is hoped that other local groups and individuals may wish to be involved – i.e. local conservation and outdoor groups may benefit from taking a Hut as an organisation – perhaps to provide accommodation options for students, volunteer or research placements, as well as local families or individuals wishing to have a retreat away from busy village life.</p>

								<p>To have the same hutting family returning to the same hut, multiple times, year on year, which is commonly within 10-50 miles from their permanent residence (Arran, Ayrshire and Glasgow is the targeted geographic for this project) we aim to build long term relationships, stable tourism and reliable income year round to local businesses, the development of close relationships and working ties to Arran and the site itself, and show an example model that directly links – tourism, place and its conservation.</p>

							<article id="location">
								<h2 class="major">Location</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hut-location-map.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The location proposed for the individual huts is an area between the top the raised beach to the south of the village of Corrie and the higher FLS plantation.</p>
								<p>Between the NS02384071 and NS 25904059, a number of individual sites (20 in all) have been identified on small, level areas of ground, having a reasonable distance between them for the sake of privacy, yet all easily accessible from the access. 
								The woodland on top of the raised beach is native birch scrub and on the flatter, more boggy area below, near the road, is mainly Alder, all naturally regenerated.</p>
								<p>The huts will be situated well above the general eye-line of the casual passer-by but still secluded and shielded from view by the natural screen of trees, even after management and selective thinning has been applied.</p>

								<h3>The Site </h3> 
								<p>As the tenant of the land, the Arran Huts Project, has permission to formally sub lease 20 plots within the site boundaries. Group members can place a hut for individual and immediate family use, for a secure 25 year period (rolling thereafter in 5 year blocks unless negotiated otherwise) </p>
								<p><strong>All development of huts must remain in keeping with the low impact, ecologically sustainable and affordable tradition of Scotland’s hutting communities.</strong>  This ethos is reflected in the definition of a hut in Scottish Planning Policy 2014. <a href="#huts">Read more about huts</a></p>
								<p>It is therefore important to note that we shall:</p> 
								<ul><li>Adhere to the principles of ecologically sustainable development in terms of design, materials, construction, waste management and access;</li>   
								<li>Be provided, and provide, robust and equitable tenancy agreements giving clarity and security to Tenant, Hutter and landowner;  </li>
								<li>Provide safeguards to prevent higher impact or unsustainable developments on the site at a later date. </li>
								<li>Provide quantifiable and worthwhile environmental benefits to the site, its resident wildlife and forest through the projects and involvement of both hutters and the local community. </li> </ul>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>We believe that the conservation, protection and reestablishment of our beautiful landscape and its wildlife has a direct link with the ethics, interests and desires of those enjoying the countryside around us here on Arran. That there is a desire for those people to connect to a place simply and affordably in the long term, to have a space to get to know and contribute to. That this can be done in a sustainable way that helps to care for and support the locality, its environment and community.</p>

								<p>Tied in firmly with the above aims, we believe that hutting could be an illustration or model of what might be possible on our island and further afield.</p> 

								<h3>The Team</h3>

								<p>Deeply passionate about the island where we grew up, and both living here now, Louise and Simon first met and became friends in March 2020. We have been working together alongside others in our community on various projects to make Arran a better place to live and help others to live here too. Louise, by this point joined by her dog Keeva, introduced Simon to the magical world and concept of hutting, and the idea to bring huts to Arran was born.   </p>

								<p>We are also very excited to be working with Daniel Postma - an archaeologist, vernacular buildings conservator, natural builder and all round good chap!</p>
								<p>Currently working working with the University of Edinburgh and the educational department at Historic Environment Scotland to develop archaeo-based designs through his and his wife’s business, <a href="https://facebook.com/archaeobuild/">Archaeo Build</a> in Crieff, Perthshire.</p>
								<p>Most of his work is aimed at applying ancient knowledge, skills and materials for the benefit of modern sustainable buildings, and we cant wait to have his support to develop the project as soon as planning allows.</p>

								<h3>Going forward</h3>

								<p>With a lot of help, patience and encouragement from Mr Fforde, his family and staff at Arran Estates, including countless hours of walking sites and report writing between us all, an ideal site was found, close to amenities but respectfully distanced from giving any audio or visual disturbance to the local community. A site on the brink of being overwhelmed and surrounded by non native invasive species (Rhododendron ponticum), with good access and transport links, and fantastic local businesses and events.  </p>

								<p>After a long process we now find ourselves at the brink of a new chapter, and one we are looking forward to sharing with those who come to join us for many years to come.  </p>

								<p>We hope to connect this project with the wider conservation, rewilding and agroforestry projects we are working on, and to in the future have further sites all over the island that are Ranger-led, self-sufficient and vibrant examples of what we can collectively achieve when land owners, users, individuals, and communities work together in creative ways that help us all.</p>
